1. Project Overview:
This project is designed to:
Scrape news articles from online sources.
Extract named entities (person names) from news content.
Classify articles into different categories.
Search for similar news articles using vector-based indexing.(future enhancement)

3. Use Cases
News Aggregation: Automatically extract and classify news for media organizations.
Sentiment & Trend Analysis: Identify key players in news articles and categorize news topics.
Automated Reporting: Fetch latest news, categorize it, and provide entity extraction insights.
Search & Retrieval: Use FAISS vectors for quick retrieval of similar news articles.(Future Enchancement)


Step-by-Step Approach: (Future consideration)
Step 1: Web Scraping for News Collection
Use requests and BeautifulSoup to extract headlines or full articles from news websites (e.g., BBC, CNN, Reuters).
Preprocess the extracted text (remove HTML tags, stopwords, special characters).
Store scraped articles in a database or a vector index for further processing.
Step 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Identifying People in News
Use SpaCyâ€™s pre-trained NER model (en_core_web_sm) to extract PERSON entities.
Filter out non-relevant entities (e.g., locations, dates, and generic terms).
Store extracted entities with their corresponding news articles.
Step 3: News Classification for Categorization
Implement rule-based or ML-based classifiers (e.g., sentence Transformers) to categorize news into predefined topics:
Finance, Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, etc.
The model can be fine-tuned with labeled datasets like AG News or Reuters datasets for better accuracy.
Step 4: FAISS-Based News Similarity Search (Future Enhancement)
Convert articles into vector embeddings using LangChain with OpenAI/BERT embeddings.
Store vectors in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast nearest-neighbor retrieval.
Query similar articles based on vector similarity.
Step 5: Streamlit UI for User-Friendly Access (Future Enhancement)

Develop an interactive dashboard for users to input text and visualize:
Extracted person names
Classified categories
Similar news retrieval results
Step 6: Deployment & Scaling (Future Consideration)
Deploy API on AWS/GCP using FastAPI & Docker.
Automate scheduled scraping for continuous updates using Celery or Airflow.
Integrate a database (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for persistent storage of articles & entities

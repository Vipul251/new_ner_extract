    articles = []
    for item in soup.find_all("div", class_="gs-c-promo-body"):
        headline = item.find("h3")
        if headline:
            articles.append(headline.text.strip())
    return articles

ner.py (Named Entity Recognition)

    return names

classifier.py (News Classification)
def classify_news(text):
    if "finance" in text.lower():
        return "Finance"
    elif "sports" in text.lower():
        return "Sports"
    elif "politics" in text.lower():
        return "Politics"
    return "General"

5. Future Enhancements:
5.1 Implementing FAISS for Vector Search
Convert articles into embeddings using LangChain & store in FAISS.
Enable similarity search based on vector representation.
5.2 Streamlit UI for Visualization
Deploy an interactive web app for querying the API.
Display extracted names, classifications, and similar articles.
5.3 Adding LLM-based Summarization
Use OpenAI GPT models via LangChain for automatic news summarization.

7. Conclusion

This API efficiently extracts, classifies, and searches news articles. It can be extended with vector search, Streamlit UI, and LLM-based summarization for better usability and AI-powered insights.
This API has been successfully tested for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tagging and article classification. Future enhancements include:
Integration with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
Deployment on cloud services for real-time access.
Expanding the scraper to fetch news from multiple sources across the internet.
By leveraging FAISS for vector search and LangChain for NLP processing, this project can evolve into a powerful news analysis too

7. Step-by-Step Approach: (Future consideration)
Step 1: Web Scraping for News Collection
Use requests and BeautifulSoup to extract headlines or full articles from news websites (e.g., BBC, CNN, Reuters).
Preprocess the extracted text (remove HTML tags, stopwords, special characters).
Store scraped articles in a database or a vector index for further processing.
Step 2: Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Identifying People in News
Use SpaCyâ€™s pre-trained NER model (en_core_web_sm) to extract PERSON entities.
Filter out non-relevant entities (e.g., locations, dates, and generic terms).
Store extracted entities with their corresponding news articles.
Step 3: News Classification for Categorization
Implement rule-based or ML-based classifiers (e.g., sentence Transformers) to categorize news into predefined topics:
Finance, Politics, Sports, Technology, Entertainment, etc.
The model can be fine-tuned with labeled datasets like AG News or Reuters datasets for better accuracy.
Step 4: FAISS-Based News Similarity Search (Future Enhancement)
Convert articles into vector embeddings using LangChain with OpenAI/BERT embeddings.
Store vectors in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast nearest-neighbor retrieval.
Query similar articles based on vector similarity.
Step 5: Streamlit UI for User-Friendly Access (Future Enhancement)

Develop an interactive dashboard for users to input text and visualize:
Extracted person names
Classified categories
Similar news retrieval results
Step 6: Deployment & Scaling (Future Consideration)
Deploy API on AWS/GCP using FastAPI & Docker.
Automate scheduled scraping for continuous updates using Celery or Airflow.
Integrate a database (PostgreSQL/SQLite) for persistent storage of articles & entitie
